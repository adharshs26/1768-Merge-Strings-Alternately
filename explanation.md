- The mergeAlternately function combines two input strings by alternately appending characters from each string. 
- It starts by iterating through the characters of both strings up to the length of the shorter one, appending one character from each string in each step. After reaching the end of the shorter string, 
it appends any remaining characters from the longer string to the result. 
- This approach ensures that all characters from both strings are included in the final merged string, preserving their original order and handling strings of different lengths gracefully.
